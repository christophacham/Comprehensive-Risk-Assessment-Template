# Comprehensive Risk Assessment Template

## Introduction

This document serves as a structured template for organizations to conduct risk assessments, focusing on identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing potential risks. It combines the NIST framework principles and the Mozilla Rapid Risk Assessment (RRA) methodology. The objective is to facilitate a straightforward yet professional evaluation of risks associated with reputational, financial and productivity impacts.

## Purpose

The purpose of this template is to guide organizations through a comprehensive assessment process, enabling them to identify vulnerabilities and implement effective mitigation strategies. It aims to ensure data protection and system integrity by addressing potential threats before they materialize.

## Risk Scenario Analysis

Describe potential threats that could impact your organization, focusing on the worst-case scenarios to understand the extent of possible damage.

## Detailed Impact Assessment

Impact assessments are crucial for understanding the severity of potential risks. This section is reorganized to provide a clear and detailed assessment for reputational, financial, and productivity impacts.

### Reputational Impact Assessment

- **0 (No Impact)**: No perceived impact or concern among stakeholders or the public.
- **1 (Minor Impact)**: Limited concern, possibly affecting a small, specific group of stakeholders or users, unlikely to attract media attention.
- **2 (Moderate Impact)**: Noticeable concern within a broader group of stakeholders, may attract localized or niche media attention.
- **3 (High Impact)**: Significant concern among a wide range of stakeholders, likely to attract national media attention.
- **4 (Very High Impact)**: Major concern, widespread among stakeholders and the public, attracting significant media attention across multiple platforms.
- **5 (Maximum Impact)**: Severe, organization-wide concern, leading to a major loss of trust among all stakeholders, dominating mainstream and international media coverage.

### Financial Impact Assessment

- **0 (No Impact)**: No financial loss or cost implications.
- **1 (Minor Impact)**: Minimal financial loss, easily absorbed within operational budgets.
- **2 (Moderate Impact)**: Noticeable financial loss, requiring budget adjustments or minor financial planning to address.
- **3 (High Impact)**: Significant financial loss, impacting operational capacity and possibly leading to long-term financial planning adjustments.
- **4 (Very High Impact)**: Major financial loss, threatening financial stability or solvency, requiring substantial intervention.
- **5 (Maximum Impact)**: Catastrophic financial loss, with potential for bankruptcy, dissolution, or major restructuring of the organization.

### Productivity Impact Assessment

- **0 (No Impact)**: No interruption to productivity or operations.
- **1 (Minor Impact)**: Minimal disruption, affecting a small team or department for a short duration.
- **2 (Moderate Impact)**: Moderate disruption, affecting multiple teams or departments, with noticeable delays in operations or delivery.
- **3 (High Impact)**: Significant disruption, affecting large portions of the organization, leading to considerable delays or halting of operations.
- **4 (Very High Impact)**: Major disruption, halting key operations or productivity organization-wide, requiring extensive recovery efforts.
- **5 (Maximum Impact)**: Complete operational shutdown, with long-term consequences for recovery and resumption of normal operations.

### Likelihood Scale

Classify the likelihood of each risk scenario occurring on a scale from 1 to 5:
- **1 (Very Unlikely)**: Once in 10 years
- **2 (Unlikely)**: Once in 5 years
- **3 (Possible)**: Once in 3 years
- **4 (Likely)**: Once per year
- **5 (Highly Likely)**: More than once per year

## Impact Assessment

Assess the impact on reputation, productivity, and finances using a 0-4 scale, where 0 indicates no impact and 4 indicates maximum impact.

## Risk Response Matrix

The Risk Response Matrix provides guidance on actions to take based on the Total Risk score calculated using the provided formula. This matrix helps organizations decide at what point they need to implement mitigation strategies to manage identified risks effectively.

### Understanding Total Risk

The Total Risk score ranges from 0 to 60, calculated as:
```
Total Risk = Likelihood x (Reputation Impact + Productivity Impact + Financial Impact)
```
### Risk Response Guidelines

| Total Risk Score | Action Level      | Recommended Actions                                             |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 - 12           | Low Risk          | Monitor the situation; no immediate action required.            |
| 13 - 24          | Moderate Risk     | Implement standard mitigation measures; regular review needed.  |
| 25 - 36          | High Risk         | Prioritize risk for immediate action; develop specific mitigation plans. |
| 37 - 48          | Very High Risk    | Execute mitigation plans urgently; allocate significant resources. |
| 49 - 60          | Critical Risk     | Immediate and comprehensive action required; executive attention needed. |

### Action Level Descriptions

- **Low Risk**: Risks in this category can be monitored as part of regular risk management processes without immediate action.
- **Moderate Risk**: These risks require standard mitigation strategies and regular monitoring to prevent escalation.
- **High Risk**: High-risk scenarios necessitate prioritized and prompt action to mitigate the risk effectively.
- **Very High Risk**: Risks at this level demand urgent attention and significant resource allocation to address and mitigate the impact.
- **Critical Risk**: The highest risk category requires immediate, comprehensive action plans and may need executive or top-level management intervention for resolution.

## Risk Assessment Table

| Risk Scenario | Likelihood | Reputation Impact | Productivity Impact | Financial Impact | Total Risk | Mitigation Strategies |
|---------------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------|-----------------------|
|               |            |                   |                     |                  |            |                       |

### Example Entry

| Risk Scenario                   | Likelihood | Reputation Impact | Productivity Impact | Financial Impact | Total Risk | Mitigation Strategies       |
|---------------------------------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| Unauthorized access to data     | 3          | 2                 | 2                   | 2                | Calculated | Implement access controls, conduct security audits |
